# Research Project 2021
---

This research project’s main goals have been the identification of the differences between classical and quantum cryptography, and the development of an application capable of simulating quantum cryptography’s quantum key distribution protocol, BB84. In order to accomplish these objectives, it was indispensable to carry out extensive research on the main concepts, principles, theorems and protocols involved in Quantum Cryptography; as well as the study of programming and coding tools. All the acquired information allowed for the development of the simulator, going through several stages. The obtained information pinpointed the strengths and weaknesses of both forms of cryptography and the application showed the risks and difficulties of using quantum cryptography with current technology, although, it has to be kept in mind that this project is only the development of a simple simulator on a standard laptop and not on a current quantum computer. Keeping that in mind, quantum cryptography cannot and should not be used nowadays because of present-day technology and the risks that this technology brings to the protocols, but, maybe one day it could replace classical cryptography in the task of protecting everyone’s digital safety.

This project consists of two parts: a theoretical investigation document and a practical application of the theme researched. While this repository only contains the documents for the practical part of the project, if you wish to read the theoretical part, please click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k-c3YkIDgxAObhr2GpbaVC8jQ2-fpjwk?usp=share_link).

As the project is currently being modified, all versions of it are in separate directories. Additionally, experiments have been separated from the rest of the code.
